# usage:
#  set your environment variables for the database host (DBHOST),
#  database user (DBUSER) and database users' password (DBPASS)
# e.g. -u testuser -p test123 -h dbhost
# will attempt to use the credentials against the target host's mariadb
#
# this will start the sqlstats program running against a remote
#  database.  If you supply the username/password/host, it'll run in
#  Flask debug mode, and you can curl it locally.
# 
DBHOST=${DBHOST:-myhost.com}
DBUSER=${DBUSER:-testuser}
DBPASS=${DBPASS:-testpass}
python sqlstats.py -u ${DBUSER} -p ${DBPASS} -h ${DBHOST}
